# Task Distribution Protocol - AI Agent Coordination

This document defines how tasks are assigned, tracked, and coordinated between AI agents working on the WASM UI development project.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Task Management Overview**

### **Concurrent Development Model**
Unlike traditional sequential development, AI agents work in **parallel streams** with synchronized integration points. This allows multiple complex features to be developed simultaneously while maintaining code consistency.

## ðŸ“‹ **Task Classification System**

### **Task Types**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TaskType {
    // Foundation tasks
    Architecture,        // High-level design decisions
    Infrastructure,      // Build, CI/CD, deployment setup
    
    // Development tasks
    Component,          // UI component development
    Integration,        // API and backend integration
    Testing,           // Test creation and validation
    Documentation,     // Spec updates and guides
    
    // Coordination tasks
    Review,           // Code and design reviews
    Merge,            // Integration and conflict resolution
    Release,          // Version management and deployment
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TaskPriority {
    Critical,    // Blocks other agents - immediate attention
    High,        // Important for current phase completion
    Medium,      // Standard development tasks
    Low,         // Enhancements and optimization
}
```

### **Task Dependencies**
Tasks are classified by their dependency relationships:
- **Independent**: Can be completed without waiting for other tasks
- **Dependent**: Requires completion of specific prerequisite tasks
- **Blocking**: Other tasks cannot proceed until this is completed
- **Parallel**: Can be worked on simultaneously with related tasks

## ðŸ”„ **Daily Task Distribution Cycle**

### **Morning Sync (08:00 UTC)**
```json
{
  "sync_type": "daily_task_distribution",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T08:00:00Z",
  "project_status": {
    "overall_health": "green",
    "active_agents": 6,
    "completion_percentage": 42.5,
    "critical_blockers": 0
  },
  "task_assignments": {
    "architecture-lead-001": [...],
    "frontend-ui-001": [...],
    "frontend-ui-002": [...],
    "frontend-ui-003": [...],
    "backend-integration-001": [...],
    "testing-qa-001": [...],
    "documentation-001": [...],
    "devops-001": [...]
  }
}
```

### **Task Assignment Algorithm**
1. **Analyze Dependencies**: Identify which tasks can be started based on completed work
2. **Agent Availability**: Check agent capacity and current workload
3. **Skill Matching**: Assign tasks to agents with optimal capabilities
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly to prevent bottlenecks
5. **Priority Weighting**: Ensure critical and blocking tasks are prioritized

## âš¡ **Real-Time Task Updates**

### **Task Status Transitions**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TaskStatus {
    NotStarted,      // Task assigned but not yet begun
    InProgress,      // Agent actively working on task
    Blocked,         // Waiting for dependency or external requirement
    Review,          // Completed and awaiting review/approval
    Testing,         // Under automated or manual testing
    Completed,       // Fully completed and integrated
    Failed,          // Task failed and requires reassignment or revision
}
```

### **Blocking Resolution Protocol**
When an agent encounters a blocker:

1. **Immediate Notification**: Send blocker alert to affected agents
2. **Impact Assessment**: Calculate downstream effects on other tasks
3. **Resolution Strategy**: Develop unblocking approach with Architecture Lead
4. **Alternative Assignment**: Reassign agent to parallel non-blocked tasks
5. **Escalation**: If blocker affects critical path, escalate to human oversight

## ðŸ”„ **Inter-Agent Coordination**

### **Dependency Management**
```json
{
  "task_id": "UI-008",
